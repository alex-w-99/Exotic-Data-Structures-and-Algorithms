# Specialized Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of some of my favorite specialized, efficient data structures and algorithms written in Java. In addition to creating these programs, I also wanted to provide an in-depth background on the value that these data structures and algorithms have in a way that made intuitive sense to me. My hope is that the intuitive-based approach to these explanations that accompany this code can be of use to at least one person out there. More specifically, the purpose of this project is not just to break down the exact mechanisms by which these data structures and algorithms per se function, but also to provide a deeper context for the rationale behind and the tradeoffs associated with the all data structures and algorithms that underlie different aspects of the software we program, test, and use today.

Please note that, given the eductional purpose of this project, things like Java "best practices", like using `private` access modifiers in conjunction with "getter" and "setter" methods, are disregarded (please see Areas for Future Improvement below).

Built and tested in Java using IntelliJ IDEA. 

## The Algorithms
- <ins>Modified Quick Select:</ins> A recursive algorithm which, like regular quick select, finds the *k*-th ranked item in an unsorted array. Modified quick select has a similar overall implementation to regular quick select, too. Unlike normal quick select, however, modified quick select is able to ensure a time-complexity of Θ(*n*) in every case, in constrast to quick select's worst-case time-complexity of Θ(*n*<sup>*2*</sup>). Modified quick select does this by ensuring that the pivot/partition index *p* is chosen such that the value *A[p]* is towards the middle chunk of the values in *A* (and thus *not* in the extreme of values in *A*). This is achieved by using medians in 5 steps: (1) The unsorted array *A* is broken into sub-arrays of length 5, where the final sub-array is of length 1 to 5 (i.e., *A[0:4]*, *A[5:9]*, ...); (2) each subarray of length 5 is sorted using insertion sort (note that this operation has time complexity Θ(1) * *n/5* = Θ(*n*), since calling insertion sort on an array of length 5 or less is a constant-cost operation and does not grow with *n*); (3) the median of the medians of each sorted sub-array, *M*, is obtained (i.e., the median of the valeus *A[2]*, *A[7]*, ...); (4) the pivot/partition index *p* = *M* is used in the partition procedure, where *p* is now guaranteed to be towards the middle of all values in *A*; (5) modified quick select recurses (at most *n* - 3*n*/10 = 7*n*/10). Considering each of these 5 steps (and to be as concrete as possible), modified quick select therefore has the recurrence T(*n*) = Θ(*n*) + Θ(*n*) + Θ(*n*) + Θ(*n/5*) + T(*7n/10*), and hence an overall time-complexity of Θ(*n*) in every case.
  - **Review of Related Terms/Concepts:**
    - **Partition**: A call to `PARTITION(A, b, e)` will rearrange the subarray *A[b:e]* in place; a common implementation of the partition procedure is to partition around the final element of the subarray. Therefore, this procedure partitions the subarray *A[b:e]* such that all values *x ∈ A[b:e]: x<A[e]* are placed to the left of *A[e]*, and all values *y ∈ A[b:e]: y>A[e]* are placed to the right of *A[e]*; i.e., *A = {x1, x2, ..., e, y1, y2, ...}* (please note that the subarrays to the left and right of element *A[e]* are *not* necessarily sorted). Partition runs in linear time, passing through the array from start to finish just one time. Partition is an important subroutine used by quick sort, quick select, and modified quick select.
    - **Quick Sort**: A recursive, divide-and-conquer, in-place sorting algorithm. A call to `QUICKSORT(A, b, e)` will (1) pick a pivot/partition index *p* (though this may be chosen by the partition procedure instead), (2) partition the array on the value *A[p]*, and (3) then use recursive calls `QUICKSORT(A, b, p-1)` and `QUICKSORT(A, p+1, e)` to sort the left and right sides of the array, respectively. In the best- and average-cases, quick sort selects a pivot/partition *p* which splits the array into roughly 2 equal parts, giving a recurrence of T(*n*) = T(*n-1*) + Θ(*n*), and hence a time-complexity of Θ(*n log n*); the pitfall of quick sort, however, is that in the worst-case, the selected pivot/partition *p* splits the array into subarrays of size 0 and *n-1*, giving a recurrence of T(*n*) = T(*n-1*) + Θ(*n*), and hence a time-complexity of Θ(*n*<sup>*2*</sup>). 
    - **Quick Select**: A recursive algorithm which finds the *k*-th ranked item in an unsorted array; operates in a similar way to quick sort and uses median statistics. For example, given array *A = {4, -1, 5, 8, 0, 11}*, the call `QUICKSELECT(A, 0, A.len-1, 3)` returns 5, the third smallest value in *A*. Quick select has the recursion T(*n*) = Θ(*n*) + T(*p*) if the *k*-th ranked item is in the left sub-array following a call to partition, and T(*n*) = Θ(*n*) + T(*n-p-1*) if the *k*-th ranked item is in the right sub-array; similarly to quick sort, the best- and average-cases occur when quick select chooses a pivot/partition *p* which splits the array into roughly 2 equal parts, resulting in a time-complexity of Θ(*n*); however, in the worst-case, the selected pivot/partition *p* splits the array into subarrays of size 0 and *n-1*, resulting in a time-complexity of Θ(*n*<sup>*2*</sup>).
  - **Advantages**: The advantage of modified quick select over regular quick select is clear; the former can guarantee a time-complexity of Θ(*n*) in all cases, while the latter's time-complexity can degrade into Θ(*n*<sup>*2*</sup>).
  - **Disadvantages**: As is evident from the code, modified quick select is very tricky to implement. Moreover, it is rare that the time-complexity of normal quick select to repeatedly choose bad pivot/partition indices *p* with values *A[p]* in the extreme of values in array *A*, resulting in a degraded time-complexity of Θ(*n*<sup>*2*</sup>).
  - **Visualization**: Please see the visualization below of how modified quick select ensures a pivot/partition index *p* = *M* which is towards the middle of all values in array *A*. For this example, an array of size 25 is chosen (hence 5 columns), and dots represent array elements.

- <ins>Push-Relabel Algorithm:</ins> Given a flow network *G = (V,E)*, a source *s*, and a sink *t*, the push-relabel algorithm finds the max flow. Unlike the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (see below), push-relabel works one vertex at a time, only considering the vertex's neighbors in the residual network, and push-relabel does not maintain the flow-conservation property throughout execution (i.e., nodes here can have capacity during execution). The basic intuition is, coming from the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, directed edges still correspond to "pipes"; vertices, however, have two new properties: (1) each vertex has an arbitrarily large reservoir that can accumulate excess, and (2) each vertex sits on a platform whose height increases as the algorithm progresses. Vertex heights determine how flow may be pushed (flow can only be pushed downhill). Moreover, the source *s* is fixed at height *V*, and sink *t* is fixed at height 0; all other vertices start at height 0 and may increase over time.
  - **Push-Relabel Order of Operations**: (1) The algorithm sends flow from vertex *s* to vertices directly connected to it by filling each outgoing pipe to capacity; i.e., saturates across the cut (*s*, *V*&#92;{*s*}). When this first flow enters the immediate vertices of source *s*, it is stored in their reservoirs (before eventually being pushed downhill). (2) At some point, we will find that the only pipes that leave a vertex *u* and are not already saturated connect to vertices with heights equal to/less than *h(u)*. To rid vertex *u* of its excess flow, we `RELABEL(u)`, increasing *h(u)* to be 1 greater than the height of vertex *u*'s lowest neighbor to which *u* has an unsaturated pipe connection. (3) Eventually, all the flow that can possibly get through to sink *t* has arrived there, constrained by pipe capacities (the amount of flow across any cut is still limited by its capacity). To make the pre-flow saturation "legal", the excess collected in the reservoirs of overflowing vertices is sent back to *s* by continuously relabeling all overflowed vertices to above *h(s) = V*. Once we have emptied these reservoirs, we have a legal, maximum flow.
  - **Review of Related Terms/Concepts:**
    - **Flow Network**: A direct graph *G = (V,E)* where each edge *(u,v)* in *G* has a non-negative capacity (or "weight"), *w(u,v)* ≥ 0. Flow networks have two special vertices: (1) a **source** *s*, a vertex with no incoming edges, and (2) a **sink** *t*, a vertex with no outgoing edges. Finally, each edge receives a flow, where the amount of flow through an edge cannot exceed its capacity *w*. Please find the flow network example image with labeled edge weights immediately below.

    - **Max Flow Problem**: Given a flow network *G* with source *s* and sink *t*, find the maximum possible flow value; in other words, with source *s* having an infinite outflow capacity, find the maximum possible inflow to sink *t*. The max flow problem has two non-obvious applications: (1) [bipartite matching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-bipartite-matching/ "GeeksforGeeks Bipartite Matching"), and (2) finding the number of disjoint paths from source *s* to sink *t* (here, all existing edges have weights of 1). 
    - **Residual Network**: Given a flow network *G* and a flow *f*, recall that the residual network *G*<sub>*f*</sub> consists of edges with capacities that represent how we can change the flow on edges of *G*. More intuitively, the residual network allows us to "cancel" an already assigned flow between two edges. The only *initial* different between a residual network and a flow network is that the former may contain both an edge *(u,v)* and its reversal *(v,u)*, while the latter only contains *(u,v)*. For a more concrete explanation/example of residual networks, please watch [this excellent video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPpmzulEmjA&ab_channel=Udacity "Residual Network Explanation Video") from Georgia Tech on YouTube. 
    - **Ford-Fulkerson Method**: The most common solution to the max flow problem (referred to as a "method" rather than an "algorithm" here because it encompasses several different implementations with varying complexities). The Ford-Fulkerson method first initializes the flow *f* to 0. Next, while there exists an augmenting path *p* in the residual network *G*<sub>*f*</sub>, it augments the flow *f* along path *p* (note that this flow must be optimal by the [Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max-flow_min-cut_theorem "Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem Wikipedia")). Using DFS to find augmenting paths, finding a path in *G*<sub>*f*</sub> is O(*E*); with max flow *f*, there are at most *f* iterations; hence, Ford-Fulkerson's time-complexity is O(*E* * *f*). To understand why this complexity's worst-case scenario can be horrendous, please read [this article](https://www.cyberpointllc.com/blog-posts/cp-worst-case-complexity-of-ford-fulkerson.php "Ford-Fulkerson worst-case scenario").
  - **Advantages**: The push-relabel algorithm runs in O(*V*<sup>2</sup> * *E*), which is asymptotically superior to the O(*V* * *E*<sup>2</sup>) time-complexity of the [Edmonds-Karp algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds-Karp_algorithm "Edmonds-Karp algorithm Wikipedia"). Moreover, the push-relabel algorithm avoids the worst-case scenario of Ford-Fulkerson (see above).
  - **Disadvantages**: As is probably obvious at this point, the push-relabel algorithm can be extremely tedious to implement (at least in my experience coding it in Java). 

## The Data Structures
- <ins>Skip Lists:</ins> A skip list is a type of linked list that is augmented with additional pointers so that each operation runs in average-case *log n* time. This is done by maintaining a linked hierarchy/levels of sub-sequences, with each successive sub-sequence skipping over fewer elements than the previous one; the selection of which elements exist in a given layer may be done randomly or deterministically (implemented randomly here, with a 50% chance an element added makes it up to the next tier), so that there are approximately *log n* layers. Skip lists are sometimes considered as an alternative to balanced binary trees.
  - **Advantages**: Skip lists have the best feature of a sorted array (namely, searching in *log n* time), while maintaining a linked list-like structure that allows insertion (not possible for a static array). 
  - **Disadvantages**: Skip lists suffer from two major problems: (1) skip lists are essentially keeping track of many linked lists at once, which negatively impacts its space-complexity (indeed, its worst-case space-complexity is O(*n log n*), which highlights this fact), and (2) skip lists have a deletion function which can be quite tricky to implement. 
  - **Visualization**: Please find an example of a skip list immediately below. For a fantastic animation of how skip lists are built and used, [please click here](https://cmps-people.ok.ubc.ca/ylucet/DS/SkipList.html "UBC Skip List Visualization").

- <ins>Red-Black Trees:</ins> A red-black tree is a type of self-balancing binary search tree (BST). Red-black trees have an additional color attribute, and must satisfy the following properties: (1) every node's color attribute is either `RED` or `BLACK`, (2) the root is `BLACK`, (3) every leaf (`NIL`) is `BLACK`, (4) if a node is `RED`, both of its children are `BLACK`, and (5) for each node, every path to its descendant leaves contains exactly *x* `BLACK` nodes. Some common alternatives to red-black trees include AVL trees, Splay trees, and treaps.
  - **Review of Related Terms/Concepts**: 
    - **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A binary tree satisfying the following properties: (1) the left sub-tree contains only nodes with keys lesser than its parent's, (2) the right sub-tree contains only nodes with keys greater than its parent's, (3) the left and right sub-trees are themselves BSTs, and (4) there are no duplicate nodes. Note that `INSERT` and `DELETE` can be implemented with linear time-complexity with respect to the BST's height (i.e., O(*h*)-time). 
    - **Self-Balancing BST**: A BST which automatically "compresses" the tree following insertion and deletion operations when possible.
    - **Why Red-Black Trees Work**: In the worst-case of a BST, nodes are added in strictly decreasing or increasing order, resulting in a glorified linked-list (and thus linear time searches, insertions, and deletions). In contrast, the properties of a red-black tree mean that its height will be at most 2*log(n+1)*, meaning all red-black tree operations can implemented in O(*log n*) time.
  - **Advantages**: A regular BST is not self-balancing, meaning that its operations will have varying time complexities (see example of linear time operations in worst-case scenario immediately above). Meanwhile, red-black trees ensure logarithmic time for all operations no matter what. 
  - **Disadvantages**: In order to preserve the "red-black" properties following `INSERT` and `DELETE` operations, the color attributes of some nodes and the tree's pointer structure must be modified. Restoring these properties involves a *rotation* operation, of which there are two types: a left rotation, and a right rotation (see image below). Suffice it to say, the 3 cases of `INSERT` and the 4 cases of `DELETE` are quite tedious to implement.

- <ins>Binomial Heaps:</ins> A binomial heap is a type of mergeable heap that acts as a priority queue; binomial heaps contain a collection of binomial trees linked at their roots, such that the roots form a linked list. Importantly, a binomial heap can only have 0 or 1 binomial tree of a given order. To that end, when calling `EXTRACT-MIN` on a binomial heap, the "orphaned" children of the obviated node are reversed in order (so to be in increasing order of order), placed in the linked list of binomial tree roots, and then `UNION` is continuously called until the binomial heap has no more than 1 binomial tree of a given order. Binomial heaps are so named because the number of nodes at a given depth correspond to elements of Pascal's Triangle.
  - **Review of Related Terms/Concepts:**
    - **Mergeable Heap**: A data structure containing several min- or max-heaps which themselves may be merged with one another via a `UNION` operation.
    - **Binomial Tree**: An ordered tree that is defined recursively; the binomial tree *B*<sub>*0*</sub> consists of a single node, and the binomial tree *B*<sub>*k*</sub> consists of two binomial trees *B*<sub>*k-1*</sub> that are linked together so that the root of one is the leftmost child of the root of the other. Binomial trees exhibit several interesting properties; for instance, a binomial tree of order *k* will have height *k* and 2<sup>*k*</sup> total nodes. 
  - **Advantages**: The `UNION` operation in a binomial heap runs in *log n* time, as compared to linear time in a binary heap.
  - **Disadvantages**: The [amortized costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis "Amortized Analysis Wikipedia") (a more realistic way to approach complexity) associated with the `INSERT`, `DECREASE-KEY`, `UNION`, `FIND-MIN` operations are *log n* time in a binomial heap, whereas these operations run in constant time in a Fibonacci heap (see below).
  - **Visualization**: Please find the generic binomial heap example immediately below, comprised of binomial trees *B*<sub>*0*</sub> through *B*<sub>*4*</sub>.

- <ins>Fibonacci Heaps:</ins>  A Fibonacci heap is a type of mergeable heap that acts as a priority queue (please see the Binomial Heaps section above for review of mergeable heaps). Fibonacci heaps are quite similar to binomial heaps - both are a collection of rooted trees that each obey the min- or max-heap property, etc. - however, they differ in 2 main ways: (1) while a binomial heap immediately consolidates its trees after each `INSERT`, a Fibonacci heap lazily defers consolidation until the next call to `EXTRACT-MIN` (or max, in the case of a max-heap), where "cleanup" is done all at once, and (2) each Fibonacci heap node has a "mark" attribute, a Boolean representing whether the Fibonacci heap node has lost a child (i.e., if its child was "cut"); if a node loses a *second* child, its mark is reset to False and the node is "promoted" to the root list. The mark of each node helps us keep each Fibonacci tree exponential in size, so that the total amount of linked lists of heap roots is ultimately logarithmic. Moreover, by the Shape Theorem, every node will have a degree less than or equal to log<sub>*φ*</sub>*n*, with golden ratio *φ* ≈ 1.618. The advantage of a Fibonacci heap over its brother binomial heap is that because the former only consolidates itself when it absolutely needs to, the *amortized* costs of `INSERT`, `DECREASE-KEY`, `UNION`, and `FIND-MIN` are O(1), in contrast to the corresponding costs in a binomial heap of O(*log n*). Fibonacci heaps are so named because the order of a Fibonacci tree in the heap with order *n* will have at least *F*<sub>*n+2*</sub> nodes in it.
  - **Review of Related Terms/Concepts:**
    - **Amortized Analysis**: In the context of the [Potential Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_method "Potential Method Wikipedia") from [amortized analysis of algorithmic complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis "Amortized Analysis Wikipedia"), Fibonacci heaps have a potential function Φ(*H*) = Trees(*H*) + 2*Marks(*H*), where Marks(*H*) calculates how many nodes have their mark set to True. 
  - **Advantages**: As mentioned in the Fibonacci heap summary above, the fact that this data structure defers its consolidation until the last second means that, using amortized analysis, it can perform all operations besides `EXTRACT-MIN` and `DELETE` (which run in O(*log n*) time) in O(1) time. This performance is essentially on par with a relaxed heap!
  - **Disadvantages**: Compared to the binomial heap, Fibonacci heaps are more complicated to implement due to requiring things like more pointers. Moreover, Fibonacci heaps have higher constant factors across all of its operations, just to reduce the *amortized* time-complexity of the 4 algorithms mentioned above in this section (the "normal" time complexity of these 4 operations are technically equivalent to that of binomial heaps).
  - **Visualization**: Please find the image of a sample Fibonacci heap immediately below (courtesy of CLRS; please see acknowledgements). Note that this specific Fibonacci heap's implementation is not necessarily the implementation of the code developed with this project (namely, the pointer structure between nodes may vary).
