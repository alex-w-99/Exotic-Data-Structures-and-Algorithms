# Exotic Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of some of my favorite rare and efficient data structures and algorithms written in Java.


The purpose of this project is not just to break down the exact mechanisms by which these data structures and algorithms per se function, but also to provide a deeper context for the rationale behind and the tradeoffs associated with the all data structures and algorithms that underlie different aspects of the software we program, test, and use today.

For example, the fact that Fibonacci Heaps are able to reduce their order of time-complexity when ???? by lazily defering clean-up until the next `Extract Min` operation helps us understand that (Binomial Heaps???).


Please note that, given the eductional purpose of this project, some Java best practices like using `private` access modifiers in conjunction with "getter" and "setter" methods are disregarded.

Concepts covered in this project include (but are not limited to) ?????>. 

Built and tested using IntelliJ IDEA. 

## The Data Structures
- <ins>Skip Lists:</ins> ???     . Skip List are therefore an alternative to balanced binary trees.
  - **Context:** ???
  - **Explanation:** ???
  - **Advantages:** ???
  - **Disadvantages:** Skip Lists have two major problems: (1) Skip Lists have a worst-case space-complexity of O(n log n), which highlights the fact that this data structure is actually keeping track of many linked lists, and (2) Skip Lists have a deletion function which can be quite tricky to implement.
