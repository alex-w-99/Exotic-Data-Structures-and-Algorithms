# Exotic Data Structures and Algorithms

A collection of some of my favorite rare and efficient data structures and algorithms written in Java.


The purpose of this project is not just to break down the exact mechanisms by which these data structures and algorithms per se function, but also to provide a deeper context for the rationale behind and the tradeoffs associated with the all data structures and algorithms that underlie different aspects of the software we program, test, and use today.

For example, the fact that Fibonacci Heaps are able to reduce their order of time-complexity when ???? by lazily defering clean-up until the next `Extract Min` operation helps us understand that (Binomial Heaps???).




Concepts covered in this project include (but are not limited to) ?????>. 

Built and tested using IntelliJ IDEA.
